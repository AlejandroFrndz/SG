        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the game is to get to the end of the level, without falling to your death, while breaking all the crates
            scattered around and collecting as many fruits as you can. But beware as some crates and platform for you to brake or stand on
            could be in a different dimension. The dimension you are is indicated by the light circling around you. Depending on it's color
            you'll be either in the blue/positive dimension or in the red/negative dimension. Things on the opposite dimension will be desplayed
            as wireframes and cannot be interacted with, that means, you'll go straight through them. The color of the wireframe indicates 
            the dimension the object belongs to. You'll have to jump and switch dimensions to safetly get to the end with all the crates
            broken. Good luck!
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>WASD --> Used to move around. W is forward, S is backwards, A to go left and D to go right</li>
            <li>Spacebar --> Jump</li>
            <li>Q --> Switch dimension</li>
            <li>O --> Toggle top view. You can use this camera to get a sense of the whole level and where you are in it</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Developer Controls</h2>
        <p>The controls desplayed here aren't meant to be used while normaly playing the game and using them may lead to undesired effects</p>
        <ul>
            <li>X --> Toggle the debug mode, which displays the fps counter and axis in the scene. It also enables the following options</li>
            <li>G --> Toggles god mode. While in this mode, you cannot fall</li>
            <li>P --> Toggles a flying camera with wich you can fly around the level to inspect things up close. Its recommended to be in god mode while using the camera as you'll move it with WASD just as you do with Blake</li>
        </ul>
